CTFx
=========

CTFx is a CTF Platform forked from [mellivora](https://github.com/Nakiami/mellivora), that focuses on low memory footprint and low server CPU usage. It has a futuristic interface that's optimized for slower hardware, meaning that there is no bulky Javascript running in the background, nor length CSS stylesheets. CTFx improves on the mellivora CTF engine by the UI redesign and the addition of new features.

## Installation
**- Install the following dependencies**
  - `nginx php-fpm php-xml php-curl php-mysql php-mbstring php-pear composer mysql-server`

**- Secure mysql server**
  - Run the command `mysql_secure_installation` and remove anonymous users, disable root login and remove the test database

**- Copy repo contents to /var/www/ctfx/**
  - Run `composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader` under /var/www/ctfx
  - Make the folder `writable` writable

**- Setup nginx**
  - Copy the recommended nginx config `install/recommended_nginx_config` to `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` - For the fastcgi_pass entry, you must change the PHP version to your current one.
  - Make sure to restart nginx after changing the config!

**- Setup MySQL**
  - sudo into `mysql`, then run the following queries:
  - `CREATE DATABASE mellivora CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;`
  - `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mellivora.* TO 'mellivora'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'mellivora_pass';` - Make sure you change the default db username and password!

  - exit `mysql`
  - `sudo mysql < install/sql/001-mellivora.sql`
  - `sudo mysql < install/sql/002-countries.sql`

**- Create Admin User**
  - Register your admin account on the website (and enable 2FA Authentication preferably)
  - Logout of your account
  - sudo into `mysql` and run the query `USE mellivora; UPDATE users SET class=100 WHERE id=1;`

## Installation Tips:
- You can change the /var/www/ctfx path, but if you do so, you must update the `MELLIVORA_CONFIG_PATH_BASE` variable in `include/config/config.inc.php`
- It is **recommended** that you change the default database password, and if you do so you must also change it in `include/config/db.inc.php`
- You can change the homepage to your liking by modifying `htdocs/home.php`. Make sure to also change the css rules in `htdocs/css/mellivora.min.css` for #ctfx-main-logo and .main-intro-text, if you want a different overall style.
- You might want to change the `MELLIVORA_CONFIG_CTF_START_TIME` and `MELLIVORA_CONFIG_CTF_END_TIME` variables in `include/config/config.inc.php`, so that each new challenge you create will have these times set as default.
